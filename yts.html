            <div class="prompt">&emsp; As you navigate the winding pathways behind the houses, the urgency in your steps persists, driven by a mix of fear and determination. The town's eerie atmosphere seems to linger in the air, and the distance you put between yourself and Greenview brings a gradual sense of liberation. The pain in your ankle, once a prominent reminder of your tumultuous escape, becomes a distant ache, overshadowed by the adrenaline pulsating through your veins. <br>&emsp; The cold night air, crisp and biting, sharpens your senses. Each breath feels like a release from the oppressive atmosphere you left behind. As you move further away, the symbols and strange occurrences that plagued Greenview start to lose their grip on your thoughts, fading like distant echoes in the wind. <br>&emsp; Skillfully avoiding the watchful eyes of the town guards, you find yourself standing at the outskirts of Greenview. The transition is palpableâ€”the air is lighter, the darkness less suffocating. A profound sense of gratitude washes over you as you realize you've successfully evaded whatever dark fate might have awaited you within the peculiar town's grasp. <br>&emsp; Guided only by the soft glow of the moonlight and the distant flickering flames of other villages, you venture further into the night. However, the pillars of flames, rather than signaling welcoming beacons, now exude a more sinister aura. The shadows cast by the flames dance with an unsettling intensity, hinting at a more ominous meaning. <br>&emsp; As you approach these distant villages, a sense of foreboding grips your heart. The flickering flames take on an eerie glow, casting long shadows that seem to whisper tales of despair and hidden secrets. Each village, it seems, harbors its own darkness, and the flames serve as both witnesses and participants in rituals that defy understanding. <br>&emsp; The captivating dance of shadows beneath the flickering flames hints at ancient spirits that may not be benevolent. Instead of promising new experiences, the flames now signify a journey into the unknown, where the mysteries are more bleak and the stories more haunting. The night becomes a canvas painted with ominous hues, and as you continue your journey, the flames in the other villages flicker like distant warnings of the darkness that permeates the world beyond Greenview.</div>

Lucy shows you where the restroom is, and after entering you lock the down and escape to the pathways behind the houses and despite your pain find a way out of this town.</div>

                <div class="button-text">&emsp; You apologies for the trouble but ask to be shown to your room, there is a nagging sense that you are in danger, the small symbols that you seen in the town square have filled you with a sense of dread and as an extra layer of security you wedge a desk chair beneath the doorknob. When you hear a knock at the front door you decide to try your luck and climb out your bedroom window. With a final drop to the pathway behind the houses. You began a cold trek.</div>
