            <div class="prompt">&emsp; To your surprise, a small figure rushes out and collides with you. Luckily, you manage to maintain your balance, avoiding a fall this time. Looking down, you see a little girl with wide eyes, seemingly shocked by the encounter. She quickly regains her composure and offers a sheepish smile. "Oops, sorry about that. I wasn't expecting anyone at the door." You assure her that it's okay, relieved that this collision didn't result in another mishap. Sarah invites you inside “sorry again I thought you were Gran.” As you enter she yells “MOM WE HAVE A GUEST,” then turns to you “want to see the picture i drew.”<br>&emsp; You hear only who you could only guess was Lucy, the girl's mother, call back “Please have a set in the living room I was about to put away supper would you care for a bowl of stew and some bread.” You call out that that would be lovely.<br>&emsp; You sit on the couch and the little girl brings over what must be her latest drawing, as she hands you the paper she says “It is what happened at last year's festival.”<br>&emsp; Her drawing is of the trees you glimpsed on in the town square but as you look, you see that what you thought were unfinished outlines are actually flames that are consuming the trees and there is a figure in the center of the blaze. You think it is weird subject matter for a little girl of her age but you dismiss it as an active imagination. You notice what at first looks like scribbles but as you focus you notice that it is a symbol that you recognize but you don't know from where, as you look upon it the hairs on the back of your neck rise and uneasiness fills your thoughts.<br>&emsp; With a lump in your throat you ask who the man in the middle of the flames is, Sarah looks over at you “I’m not supposed to say, but you seem nice so i think you should run.” Sarah then gives you a little smile, gets up, and heads to what you assume is her room.<br>&emsp; Lucy then brings in a bowl of stew and bread.As she offers you the find she goes over the cost of a night's stay.

Lucy shows you where the restroom is, and after entering you lock the down and escape to the pathways behind the houses and despite your pain find a way out of this town.</div>

                <div class="button-text">&emsp; You apologies for the trouble but ask to be shown to your room, there is a nagging sense that you are in danger, the small symbols that you seen in the town square have filled you with a sense of dread and as an extra layer of security you wedge a desk chair beneath the doorknob. When you hear a knock at the front door you decide to try your luck and climb out your bedroom window. With a final drop to the pathway behind the houses. You began a cold trek.</div>
